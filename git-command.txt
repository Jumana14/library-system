The library system folder doesn't have any code, 
We will commit this folder in the github with the new repository named library-system

Step1: We switched to the folder which we need to commit
    cd /folder_name/
if it is inside that folder again write that above command

Step2: We initialized the git
    git init

Step3: We will add all the files:
    git add .
If we want to add a particular file, then
    git add file_name

Step4: We will commit with some description:
    git commit -m "Commit Description"

Step5:  We will switch to main branch if we are not on main branch:
    git branch -M main

Step6: At this step we can create a repository with the name we have given in package.json or before performing
the git operations

Step7: We will add our files to the remote repository using the below command
    we can add using https or ssh, here we are going to use ssh
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Jumana14/library-system.git

Step8: Now we will push the files to the remote repository
    git push -u origin main


Lets make changes in line 33

We got an error saying:
    $ git remote add origin https://git@github.com/Jumana14/library-system.git
    error: remote origin already exists.
So chatgpt said to set the url 
    git remote set-url origin https://git@github.com/Jumana14/library-system.git

In this line I am making changes to resolve the conflicts that will occur in the main branch

What is the reason for this error? how should I fix this error
In this line I am making changes to resolve the conflicts that will occur in the main branch

when I try to push, I got this error:

fatal: 'git@github.com/Jumana14/library-system.git' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.


I have tried to commit using both ssh key and url 
for url , you need to perfom git remote set-url origin (link) command, and then git remote add origin (url)
for ssh key, you need to give direct git remote add origin (ssh-key)


to switch to another branch, we do the below command:
    git checkout -b branch_name


to switch to another branch, we do the below command:
    git checkout -b branch_name
