The library system folder doesn't have any code, 
We will commit this folder in the github with the new repository named library-system

Step1: We switched to the folder which we need to commit
    cd /folder_name/
if it is inside that folder again write that above command

Step2: We initialized the git
    git init

Step3: We will add all the files:
    git add .
If we want to add a particular file, then
    git add file_name

Step4: We will commit with some description:
    git commit -m "Commit Description"

Step5:  We will switch to main branch if we are not on main branch:
    git branch -M main

Step6: At this step we can create a repository with the name we have given in package.json or before performing
the git operations

Step7: We will add our files to the remote repository using the below command
    we can add using https or ssh, here we are going to use ssh
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Jumana14/library-system.git

Step8: Now we will push the files to the remote repository
    git push -u origin main
